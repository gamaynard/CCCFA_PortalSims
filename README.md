# CCCFA Portal Simulations

The CCCFA Portal Simulations repository contains a set of interactive simulations (and their supporting files) used to inform decision making around projects that the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance is actively engaged in. Code for the simulations themselves is written in R. The graphical user interfaces are written in R Shiny. To view the graphical interface for the simulations, please visit [the CCCFA simulation homepage](https://simulations.fisheriestrust.xyz), which is under development and non-functional as of 2020-08-28.
